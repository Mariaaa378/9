<p class="lw">Arctic Monkeys<hr></p>
<article>
    <p>British group from Sheffield, 2002 – Present<hr></p>

    <p>Arctic Monkeys' musical style has been mainly described as indie-rock,garage-rock, post-pank, altermative rock and other. A key part of their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. </p>

    <p> According to Vice, «in Britain at least, Arctic Monkeys have reached a point where they are too enormous, too beloved a force to truly fail» and are probably the UK's biggest, most culturally important band.</p>
